# Structure
## An app to track your workouts ðŸ’ª

Structure is an android app written in Kotlin, utilising Jetpack Compose. You can build, your own workouts and track your progress while you get stronger. This app uses Room to store data in an SQL database and Kotlin Coroutines and Flows to retrieve data asynchronously. This app demonstrates MVVM architecture and Android's recommended Repository pattern. This is the minimum viable product for this SAS idea and has many features yet to come. Such as:

  -> a timer function

  -> functionality to edit routines mid workout

  -> data analysis of historical workouts
  
## Some short screen grabs of the basic features: 
  
## Enter Data for your workout, and view previous entries.
